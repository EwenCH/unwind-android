    <string name="introduction_text1">At Unwind, we get it. Sometimes life gets too much.
                                    More and more of us are busy, stressed and anxious.
                                    It is important to unwind - hence our name.</string>

    <string name="introduction_text2">Unwind is here to help you take five during your busy day,
                                    and you can make of it what you want. It can be a daily journal
                                    of what is troubling you, and offer you guidance on what to do
                                    about it. That might be a meditation exercise, or just helping
                                    you plan your week. You can also ask us where to
                                    find help locally.</string>
