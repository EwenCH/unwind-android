Unwind is an AI chatbot created in 54 hours at Sync the City (A Norwich-based startup competition) by 9 people. Unwind is there for people to unload any stresses or anxieties they may be feeling - and suggest ways to feel better.

## Installation
You can find the APK [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=18KI5YvlS_2ZwqUqEekzPmjUdezViXX6A).

## Disclaimer
Unwind is in a primitive/prototype stage (the AI has only one day of training behind it) so it is not recommended to actually use the app in any therapeutic way.
